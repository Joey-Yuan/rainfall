# rainfall
This interactive mouse-based project documents the rainfall recorded across various districts in Hong Kong during the first rain brought by Typhoon Mujigae.

By clicking on the project, a randomly selected district's rainfall data from that period will be displayed. 
The intensity of the rainfall in the area determines the size of the puddles and raindrops that appearâ€”the heavier the rainfall, the larger the puddles and raindrops generated.

## How to Run

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas matplotlib

3. Run the script:
